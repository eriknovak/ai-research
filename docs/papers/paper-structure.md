# Paper Structure

This page describes how one can structure the outline of a scientific paper.
In addition to the structure, it also describes the content of each section.
**Note that this is just an example of a paper structure - do whatever
you think is best.**


## Title
The title needs to tell what the paper is about.


## Authors
The authors of the paper. Depending on the journal, the authors may be listed
in a different order.

The author list should also include the affiliation of each author. The affiliation
should include the name of the institution, the city, and the country.

Don't forget to include the corresponding author. The corresponding author is the
person who is responsible for the paper. The corresponding author is usually the
first author.


## Abstract

The abstract should be a short summary of the paper. The abstract should be
self-contained and should not refer to other parts of the paper. The abstract
should be written in the past tense.

Some points the abstract should cover:

1. Motivation

2. Contribution (method, data set, etc.)

3. How was the contribution evaluated?

4. Results overview


## Introduction

The introduction/motivation for the research. As an advice, structure the
paragraphs such that (1) the first sentence is a statement, (2) the following
sentences are arguments for the statement, and (3, optional) provide an example
where the statement holds.

Some points the introduction should cover:

1. The broad view of the problem

2. The current solutions and how they work [do not go into details]

3. The limitations of the current solutions [introduction to the problem]

4. Research objectives and contributions

    1. What is the main aim of the research [what is the solution you want to
       find]

    2. What are the objectives of the research [how are you going to find the
       solution]

    3. The description of the actual solution, how it was evaluated, and a brief
       overview of the results

    4. List of scientific contributions of the paper

5. Paper structure [per section]


## Related Work
The description of the work performed in the fields related to your research.

!!! Tip
    It is advised to include related work that was published in the journal you
    wish to submit to.


## Methodology
How to solve the problem split into two parts: theory and implementation.

1. Theory [the mathematical description of the solution]

2. Implementation [the model architecture or step-by-step description of the
   methodology]


## Experiment Setting
The experiment setting describes how the proposed solution was evaluated. The
experiment setting should include the following sections:

1. **Data Set.** The description of the data set used for the evaluation. The
   data set should include the following information:

    1. The data set description

    2. Data set pre-processing

    3. Data set statistics

2. **Evaluation Metrics.** The description of metrics used to evaluated the
   solution. The evaluation metrics should include the following information:

    1. The description of the metric

    2. The formula of the metric

    3. The interpretation of the metric

3. **Baseline methods.** The methods used to compare the proposed solution with.
   The baseline methods should include the following information:

    1. The description of the method

    2. Citation to the related work

4. **Implementation details.** The details of how the solution was implemented.
   The implementation details should include the following information:

    1. The description of the hyper- and training parameters

    2. Libraries and frameworks used

    3. Possible link to the code


## Evaluation Results
The section containing the results of the evaluation. It can contain (1) tables
with metric scores, and (2) figures with the results.


## Discussion
The discussion should contain the findings the evaluation results imply.

1. Performance comparison between the proposed solution and the baseline methods

2. Advantages of the proposed solution over the baseline methods

3. Disadvantages of the proposed solution over the baseline methods


## Conclusion
The conclusion should summarize the main findings of the paper.

1. The main findings of the paper

2. How does the findings contribute to the field [connection to the introduction]


## Future Work
Possible next steps to advance the research.


## Acknowledgements
