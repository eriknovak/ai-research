# How to Start

This section contains information on how to start writing a paper. The
information in this section is based on the experience of the authors of these
guidelines. Note that you don't have to follow these guidelines. You can follow
any guidelines you want. However, we recommend you to follow what is written ž
here.

## Running Experiments

1. **Create an account on GitHub.** If you don't have an account, you can
   create one [here](https://github.com).

2. **Create a GitHub repository.** The repository is where you will have all of
   your code used to perform the experiments you are interested in. Add the
   collaborators to the repository. The collaborators are the people who will
   help you with the experiments.

3. **Perform the experiments.** Write the code, download the data, run the
   experiments, and save the results. Once you run an experiment, save the model
   version, the code version, hyper-parameters, and the results. This will help
   you to reproduce the results in the future.

    Once you run an experiment, we suggest so save the code as a separate branch
    in the repository. This will help you to reproduce the results in the future.

When you are done, you can start writing the paper.

## Writing the Paper

1. **Create an account on Overleaf.** If you don't have an account, you can
   create one [here](https://www.overleaf.com).

2. **Get Overleaf Premium Account (optional).** To get the premium account, you
   need to create an account on IEEE Colabratec. You can create an account
   [here](https://ieee-collabratec.ieee.org/). After creating an account, go to
   “Account Settings > Attached Services“ and connect to your Overleaf account.
   Make sure you link the same account you created in step 2.

3. **Write the paper.** You can write the paper using Overleaf. Add the authors
   of the paper as collaborators. The authors are the people who helped you with
  the experiments and the paper.

4. **Find a journal.** Find a journal where you want to submit the paper. We
   suggest you find a journal that is related to the field of your research. Also,
   have a list of possible journals in case the first journal rejects your paper.

5. **Submit the paper.** Once you are done with the paper, submit it to the
   journal. The journal will review the paper and will either accept or reject
   it. If the paper is rejected, you can submit it to another journal.

### Usual Submission Requirements

Depending on the journal, the submission requirements may vary. However, the
following requirements are usually common:

1. The paper should be written in English
2. A document containing the paper highlights (3-5 lines with max 85 characters,
   including spaces)
3. Author Agreement Statement
4. Cover Letter
5. Declaration of Competing Interests
6. Credit Author Statement
