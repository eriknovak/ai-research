# Technology Stack

This page contains the info about the technologies that we used for research and
in projects.

**Main Goals**

- To use technology that is known to the majority of the team

- To use technology such that other team members can help and/or maintain the code

**While some of the items are prefered over others (depicted with :sparkles:),
these are just guidelines to achieve the above mentioned goals.**

## Programming Languages

- :sparkles: **[Python]**, **[Conda]**

- **[NodeJS]**, **[JavaScript]**, **[TypeScript]**

- **[C++]**

## ML Libraries

- :sparkles: **[Scikit-learn].** It is a free software machine
  learning library for the Python programming language. It features various
  classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector
  machines, ...

- :sparkles: **[PyTorch].** It is a machine learning framework based on
  the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural
  language processing, originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux
  Foundation umbrella.

- **[TensorFlow].** It is a free and open-source software library for
  machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of
  tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural
  networks.

- **[HuggingFace].** It is most notable for its Transformers library
  built for natural language processing applications and its platform that allows
  users to share machine learning models and datasets.

- **[PyG].** It is a library built upon PyTorch to easily write and train
  Graph Neural Networks for a wide range of applications related to structured
  data.

- **[QMiner].** Analytic platform for real-time large-scale streams
  containing structured and unstructured data. Developed at the E3 department.

## Databases

- :sparkles: **[PostgreSQL].** Also known as Postgres, it is a free
  and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility
  and SQL compliance.

- **[Redis].** It is an in-memory data structure store, used as a
  distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with
  optional durability.

- **[InfluxDB].** It is an open-source time series database developed by
  the company InfluxData. It is written in the Go programming language for storage
  and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring,
  application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics.

- **[TimescaleDB].** It expands PostgreSQL for time series and
  analytics. Handle relentless streams of time-series data with the performance,
  scalability, and usability that your application needs.

- **[Apache Kafka].** It is a distributed event store and stream-processing
  platform. It is an open-source system developed by the Apache Software
  Foundation written in Java and Scala. The project aims to provide a unified,
  high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.

## Services

- **[Elasticsearch].** It is a search engine based on the Lucene
  library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine
  with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

- **[Kibana].** It is a source-available data visualization dashboard
  software for Elasticsearch, whose free and open source successor in OpenSearch
  is OpenSearch Dashboards.

## Frontend Development

- :sparkles: **[React].** It is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript
  library for building user interfaces based on UI components.

- **[Angular].** It is a TypeScript-based free and open-source web
  application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of
  individuals and corporations.

## Design

- :sparkles: **[Figma].** It is a collaborative web application for
  interface design, with additional offline features enabled by desktop
  applications for macOS and Windows.

## Reports

- :sparkles: **[Microsoft Word].** Microsoft Word is a word processing
  software developed by Microsoft.

- :sparkles: **[LaTeX]; [Overleaf].** LaTeX is a high-quality
  typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of
  technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for
  the communication and publication of scientific documents.
