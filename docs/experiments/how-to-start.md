# How to Start

This section contains information on how to run experiments. The
information in this section is based on the experience of the authors of these
guidelines. Note that you don't have to follow these guidelines. You can follow
any guidelines you want. However, we recommend you to follow what is written
here.

## Running Experiments

1. **Create an account on GitHub.** If you don't have an account, you can
   create one [here](https://github.com).

2. **Create a GitHub repository.** The repository is where you will have all of
   your code used to perform the experiments you are interested in. Add the
   collaborators to the repository. The collaborators are the people who will
   help you with the experiments.

3. **Perform the experiments.** Write the code, download the data, run the
   experiments, and save the results.

   Once you run an experiment, save the model version, the code version,
   hyper-parameters, and the results. Also, we suggest so save the code as a
   separate branch in the repository. This will help you to reproduce the
   results in the future.

When you are done, you can [Write a Paper].
